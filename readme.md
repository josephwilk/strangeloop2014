# Welcome to the world of SOUND♪

Come with us now on a journey through space and sound ♪♫. 

```
:D  - who me?
/█\
.Π.
```

You have at your hands the capability to make every sound imaginable.

```clojure
(definst creativity [amp 9999] (* amp (lf-saw 300)))
```

Unplug those headphones,

```
d[-_-]b
  /█\
  .Π.
```

adjust your volume

```
█ ▆ ▅ ▃  Volume @ 50%
```

and your ears are ready to begin their journey.


##> Before you begin your travels

```
                                    __
    :O  Urm... please wait        <'..'>
   /█\  I'm installing Java        (oo)_/6
   .Π.                               W W
```

A good journey always starts with getting all your equipment prepared.
Its rarely fun but hey, you don't want to stand live on stage installing Java.

```
git clone git@github.com:josephwilk/strangeloop2014.git && cd strangeloop2014 && make
```

The path you choose dictates what you need to setup.

Also no matter what, you will need to pick and prepare an instrument: [Vim, Emacs, Lighttable](instruments/readme.md)

##> You reach a fork in the road

```
   -----          -------
  |Power|        |Freedom|
   -----          -------
    \   \         /   /
     \   \       /   /
      \   \     /   /
       \   \   /   /
        \   :?    / 
         \  /█\  /
          \ .Π. /  

One path leads to instant power but you are never truely free.
The other leads to complete freedom but you have to build your world from scratch.
```

###> You encounter a Tidal. It seems to want to play.

```
 \:O  Hi
  █\          ,(   ,(   ,(   ,(   ,(
./ \.      `-'  `-'  `-'  `-'  `-'  `
```

Tidal, a Haskell framework focusing on conciseness, building up complicated patterns manipulating samples quickly.

###> Armed with braces you enter the Overtone

```
                .d88b.
*gulp*  :\     d88""88b
         █-((  88    88
       .//.    Y88..88P
                "Y88P"

Overtone, a Clojure framework provides a lot of freedom, but at the cost of being more verbose and requiring you to build your own abstractions. It is a Clojure client to the SuperCollider sound engine.

###> Out of a bush bursts a swarm of Sonic-PIs

```
  \:o/     π      π
   █       π   π   π   π
 .||.     π  π  π
```

Sonic-PI is an IDE for live coding music using Ruby. It comes pre-packaged in a nice dmg file which means its very quick to get started. But alas only on OS X for now.

##> Before you return home

```
 \:D   ♪♫  ♪ ♫
  █ \    ♫  ♪  ♪

```

In our final session we will have some space for people to demos what they have done.
